## Objective/Situation
Our bank was facing a high churn rate, with too many customers leaving, which was hurting our revenue and customer loyalty. We needed to understand why customers were leaving and find ways to keep them. To do this, we needed a detailed analysis of our customer data.

## Task
As a data analyst, my job was to create a Bank Churn Analysis Dashboard using Power BI. This dashboard needed to give us a clear picture of customer demographics, churn rates, and other important metrics. The goal was to help our management and marketing teams make better decisions to keep our customers happy and reduce churn.

## Action
### Data Collection and Preparation:

I collected data from various bank csv files, including information about customer demographics, account activity, credit scores, and product ownership.
I cleaned and prepared the data to ensure it was accurate and consistent. This involved handling missing values and standardizing formats.
### Dashboard Design and Development:

I designed the dashboard to be intuitive and user-friendly, ensuring it met the needs of our bank managers and analysts.
I created visualizations using Power BI, including bar charts, pie charts, and line graphs to represent key metrics such as:
